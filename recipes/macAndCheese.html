<p>An upscale mac and cheese! Don't skimp on the cheese! It makes the mac and cheese taste amazing! </p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul class="ingredients">
    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
    <li>2 large onions, very thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg, or to taste</li>
    <li>Â¾ pound shredded Gruyere cheese </li>
</ul>
<h2>Method:</h2>
<ol class="method">
    <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onions, thyme, and bay leaf in the butter for 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until onions are browned, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Transfer to a plate and discard the bay leaf. Reserve the skillet.</li>
    <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.</li>
    <li> Meanwhile, melt remaining butter in the reserved skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour for 1 minute, then whisk in beef broth and milk and bring to a boil; season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. </li>
    <li> Reduce heat and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in Gruyere cheese until melted.</li>
    <li> Drain macaroni and toss with onion and sauce until well combined.</li>
